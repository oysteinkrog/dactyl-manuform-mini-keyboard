print-5.6:
TODO how is the new thumb layout?
TODO how is the increased tenting


print-5.4:
new thumbs are good, better than old, less tired in thumb due to less movement, could still be better
less spacing between rows is good, but do need the column spacing otherwise feels too tight
the reduction in tenting is bad, feel it entire hand, quest for portability/flatness it not worth it.
this thumb layout w/earlier tenting would be nice.
lower arm wrist rests (pivoting design from aliexpress) has reduced need for wrist rests


beta-1: 
rotated wrist rests are not working out.
screen is working ok, but not using much.
rotary knobs also ok, but also not using much.
want to try less key spacing.
rounding on wrist rests is good.
